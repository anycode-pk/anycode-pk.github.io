# Exciting Equipment Update!

We are thrilled to announce a significant enhancement to our collection of tools and gadgets for the AnyCode community! Thanks to the support of our dedicated patron dr Rafał Wojszczyk, we have recently acquired the following state-of-the-art equipment:

- Arduino Giga x2
- LoRa 868 MHz x2
- Radio for Drones 2.0 x2
- Multimedia Board with ESP32-Wroover x1

These additions will undoubtedly open up new possibilities for experimentation, learning, and innovation within our community. Whether you're into hardware tinkering, IoT projects, or drone development, we've got you covered!

**Join the Adventure with AnyCode society!**
If you're passionate about coding, hardware, or just curious about what we do, we invite individuals outside our circle to join us on this exciting journey. Don't miss out on the opportunity to start your coding adventure with AnyCode! Every week at Thursday 14:00 in 103-1D class.

Stay tuned for upcoming workshops and projects that will make the most out of our shiny new toys. Let's continue pushing the boundaries of technology together!
